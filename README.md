# Roguelike 2D Platformer Game
 
* This is a 2D platformer game in the roguelike genre developed in Java. In this game, players can wield various weapons and customize their abilities using a collection of gems. Different gems have different synergies with each other which give additional effects to the player's chosen abilities. This feature is designed to create a unique experience for every run.
* I have also developed an integrated a level editor that facilitates rapid level creation and automatically updates its contents as the game is developed.
